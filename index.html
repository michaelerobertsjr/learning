            Who has learned something new today?

            I'd like to talk to you briefly about a topic that is relevant to anyone learning a new skill.

            We're going to talk about how to acquire skills more effectively.

            Or if you will: learning how to learn.

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Growth mindset</strong>: you can improve your skills with effort</li>
            <li>Recognize that struggling helps you learn</li>
            <li>Make sure you struggle and know that it helps</li>
            <li>"If you think you can or canâ€™t, you are right."</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - I don't have the skills that I do because I'm brilliant
            - I have the skills that I do because I acquired them over time through work, play, and help from others
            - When you have a **growth mindset** you know that you *can* learn the skills you want to learn.  It will require effort, but you **absolutely** can do it.
            - Recognizing that struggling *helps* you learn actually *allows* struggling to help you learn.
            - I'm going to say that again.
            - Struggling helps you learn, but only if you recognize that struggling helps you learn.
            - So make sure you struggle and know that struggling helps learning.

            - You want to make sure you're working at the edge of your ability: not too far off the edge, but *not* inside your comfort zone
            - If you're completely comfortable, you're not learning
            - But if you're completely overwhelmed, you're not going to learn either
            - In order to learn, you need to continually keep yourself *just* outside of your comfort zone
            - Take on tasks that you can't do on your own yet, but you might be able to do with a bit of Googling and asking for help
            - If you take little steps just beyond your abilities everyday, you will learn and you will grow

          <h2>Active Retrieval</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning happens from retrieval, not consumption</li>
            <li>Quizzing yourself is more effective than re-reading</li>
            <li>Quiz yourself early and quiz yourself often</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Have you ever heard people say "practice makes perfect"?
            - There's a reason they say that.
            - Practice isn't about putting information in your brain
            - Practice is all about retrieving information from your brain
            - Obtaining information is easy
            - Retrieving information is hard
            - **testing yourself** on what you've learned so far is *very* often **more useful** than re-reading** or re-watching material
            - Test yourself at the end of all learning. If you consume information and you fail to test yourself on what you learned afterward, you will not learn.

          <h2>Active Retrieval Example</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Try to solve a programming exercise</li>
            <li>Don't look at the exercise for at least 24 hours</li>
            <li>Look at solutions for the exercise and reflect on them</li>
            <li>Don't look at the exercise for at least 24 hours</li>
            <li>Try to solve the exercise again and repeat from step 2</li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Here's an example of one way to practice active retrieval
            - You could try to solve a programming exercise... it doesn't matter whether you do solve, it matters that you try to solve it and you struggle while doing so
            - And then step away from it, for a day
            - And when you come back look at solutions to the exercise and reflect on what you see
              - What's new to you in the answers?  What can you figure out from them?
              - If you solved the exercise, how could you have solved it *better*?
            - And then step away again, for at least a day
            - And try to solve the same exercise again, without looking at your previous attempts or the solutions

        <section>
          <h2>Interleaved Practice</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocked practice</strong>: practice one skill repeatedly</li>
            <li><strong>Interleaved practice</strong>: work on multiple skills in parallel</li>
            <li>Blocking feels effective, but interleaving <em>is</em> effective</li>
            <li>Mix together different skills when practicing</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - When you practice the same thing over and over, you'll feel smarter.  But you're tricking yourself!
            - It's more effective to mix up your learning
            - Come up with different chunks of stuff and then mix them together
            - Try not to practice the same skill twice in a row
            - Don't work on one topic all day: do a little of bit Django models
            - It would be better to practice Django models, templates, and views all intermixed

        <section>
          <h2>Spaced Practice</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>don't cram: space out your practicing</li>
            <li>take breaks, go for a walk</li>
            <li>pause in the middle of learning topics</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Who has watched an entire season of Netflix in a day?  That's binge-watching.
            - When I was in school I tried to binge-learn: I crammed for exams
            - Cramming doesn't work.  When you cram, you may remember something for a short period but you won't retain that knowledge.
            - While learning, you want to space out your practice
            - Don't try to binge-learn everything in a weekend
            - If possible, set aside a *little* of time for practice every day
            - And if you have to learn in big blocks of time, make sure you take lots of breaks
            - Every 25 minutes: stop what you're doing and take a five minute break

          <h2>Elaboration</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Elaboration</strong>: describing an idea in your own words</li>
            <li>Try explaining an idea to someone else in simple terms</li>
            <li>Give a lightning talk on something you learned recently</li>
            <li>Make connections between ideas whenever possible</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Have you ever heard someone say the best way to learn is to teach?
            - When you explain a complex idea in your own words, you're elaborating
            - Explaining how things relate to each other is also elaboration
            - Whenever you reframe an idea or connect multiple ideas, you're strengthening your learning
            - **Analogies** are one of my favorite ways to re-enforce learning
            - Take a concept you're learning and try to think of something in the real world that it's similar to and explain that concept using that real world thing
            - You've just made an analogy
            - If you use an analogy to explain a programming concept to someone who's never programmed before, you are re-enforcing your learning through elaboration

          <h2>Recap: How to Learn</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Retrieve: quiz yourself as often as possible</li>
            <li>Growth mindset: know that struggling helps</li>
            <li>Interleave: practice different skills at the same time</li>
            <li>Spacing: remember to take breaks</li>
            <li>Elaborate: make connections between different ideas</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Let's do a recap
            - The way to stop your brain from *forgetting* new ideas is to **actively retrieve** those ideas from your brain by quizzing yourself
            - As you quiz yourself, make sure you're struggling and know that **struggling helps learning**
            - Don't practice one skill over and over: **interleave** different skills when you practice
            - Take breaks often: don't binge-learn and don't cram
            - **Practice elaboration**. Explain an idea to a friend without using fancy programming terms... only use *plain English* when you're explaining things
            - Make connections between different ideas and make *lots* analogies
            - Analogies are fun, silly, *and* productive learning tools

            - During this talk I've actually been practicing elaboration
            - I teach for a living, but I don't a background in education
            - So I've been *learning* about learning
            - And this is one of the books I've read on this topic
            - Everything I explained in this talk is discussed in much greater detail in this book
            - If you're a teacher, I recommend reading this book
            - If you're really interested in honing your learning techniques, I'd also recommend this book
