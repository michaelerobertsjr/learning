            This talk is aimed at new programmers, but the topics I'm discussing are relevant for anyone learning a new skill.

            We're going to learn about learning.

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Growth mindset</strong>: you can improve your skills with effort</li>
            <li>Recognize that struggling helps you learn</li>
            <li>Make sure you struggle and know that it helps</li>
            <li>"If you think you can or canâ€™t, you are right."</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - I don't have the skills that I do because I'm brilliant
            - I have the skills that I do because I acquired them over time through work, play, and help from others
            - When you have a **growth mindset** you know that you *can* learn the skills you want to learn.  It will require effort, but you **absolutely** can do it.
            - Recognizing that struggling *helps* you learn actually *allows* struggling to help you learn.
            - I'm going to say that again.
            - Struggling helps you learn, but only if you recognize that struggling helps you learn.
            - So make sure you struggle and know that struggling helps learning.

          <h2>Active Retrieval</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning happens from retrieval, not consumption</li>
            <li>Quizzing yourself is more effective than re-reading</li>
            <li>Quiz yourself early and quiz yourself often</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Have you ever heard people say "practice makes perfect"?
            - There's a reason they say that.
            - Practice isn't about putting information in your brain
            - Practice is all about retrieving information from your brain
            - Obtaining information is easy
            - Retrieving information is hard
            - **testing yourself** on what you've learned so far is *very* often **more useful** than re-reading** or re-watching material
            - Test yourself at the end of all learning. If you consume information and you fail to test yourself on what you learned afterward, you will not learn.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Interleaved Practice</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocked practice</strong>: practice one skill repeatedly</li>
            <li><strong>Interleaved practice</strong>: work on multiple skills in parallel</li>
            <li>Blocking feels effective, but interleaving <em>is</em> effective</li>
            <li>Mix together different skills when practicing</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - When you practice the same thing over and over, you'll feel smarter.  But you're tricking yourself!
            - It's more effective to mix up your learning
            - Come up with different chunks of stuff and then mix them together.
            - If you're solving programming exercises, a good strategy is to randomize exercises that use different skills.
            - Try not to practice the same skill twice in a row.
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Spaced Practice</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>don't cram: space out your practicing</li>
            <li>take breaks, go for a walk</li>
            <li>pause in the middle of learning topics</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - When I was in School I crammed for many tests
            - Cramming doesn't work.  It remembered what I needed on the test, but forgot it very quickly afterward.
            - Remember to interleave your practice... you want to practice multiple things at once
            - so don't take break between topics, take breaks in the middle of topics
            - Take breaks at unnatural times: say every 25 minutes take a 5 minute break

        <section>
          <h2>Elaboration</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Elaboration</strong>: describing an idea in your own words</li>
            <li>Try explaining an idea to someone else in simple terms</li>
            <li>Give a lightning talk on something you learned recently</li>
            <li>Make connections between ideas whenever possible</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Have you ever heard someone say the best way to learn is to teach?
            - When you explain a complex idea in your own words, you're elaborating
            - Explaining how things relate to each other is also elaboration
            - Whenever you reframe an idea or connect multiple ideas, you're strengthening your learning
            - **Analogies** are one of my favorite ways to re-enforce learning
            - Here's some analogies:
              - **Caching** and expiration dates on food
              - **Generators** and watching a YouTube video
              - **Asynchronous programming** and planning a birthday party

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Retrieve: quiz yourself as often as possible</li>
            <li>Growth mindset: know that struggling helps</li>
            <li>Interleave: practice different skills at the same time</li>
            <li>Spacing: remember to take breaks</li>
            <li>Elaborate: make connections between different ideas</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Stop your brain from *forgetting* new things by **actively retrieving** things from your brain
            - As you quiz yourself, make sure you're struggling and know that **struggling helps learning**
            - Don't participate in blocked practice: **interleave** different skills when you practice
            - Take breaks often, but make sure you're interleaving
            - **Practice elaboration**. Explain an idea to a friend without using fancy software engineering and computer science terms... no polymorphism, no scope, no coupling: just *plain English*
            - Make connections between different ideas and make *lots* analogies
            - Analogies are fun, silly, *and* productive learnings
            - And most importantly, give a lightning talk at the next San Diego JavaScript on a new thing you've learned and explain the idea in your own words

            - Everything I explained in this talk is discussed in much greater detail in this book
            - If you're a teacher, I recommend reading this book
            - If you're really interested in honing your learning techniques, I'd also recommend this book
